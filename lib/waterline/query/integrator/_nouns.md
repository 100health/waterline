### ontology


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology


##### Abstract Object Theory

"An Introduction to Axiomatic Metaphysics" is the title of a publication by Edward Zalta that outlines abstract object theory.

On Zalta's account, some objects (the ordinary concrete ones around us, like tables and chairs) "exemplify" properties, while others (abstract objects like numbers, and what others would call "non-existent objects", like the round square, and the mountain made entirely of gold) merely "encode" them.

  - For every set of properties, there is exactly one object that encodes exactly that set of properties and no others.
  - This allows for a formalized ontology.

##### Problem: "type-token ambiguity"



####### Pierce's Type-Token Distinction

> In order that a Type may be used, it has to be embodied in a Token which shall be a sign of the Type, and thereby of the object the Type signifies.
> – Peirce 1906, Ogden-Richards, 1923, 280-1.

Type/Form:   letter
(a collection of the platonic ideals of letters like "A", "B", and "Z")

Token/Inscription:  letter
(a particular instance of a letter "A", "B", etc.)

There are only 26 letters in the English alphabet and yet there are more than 26 letters in this sentence. Moreover, every time a child writes the alphabet 26 new letters have been created.

The letters that are created by writing are physical objects that can be destroyed by various means: these are letter TOKENS or letter INSCRIPTIONS. The 26 letters of the alphabet are letter TYPES or letter FORMS.



Peirce's type-token distinction, also applies to words, sentences, paragraphs, and so on: to anything in a universe of discourse of character-string theory, or concatenation theory.[2] There is only one word type spelled el-ee-tee-tee-ee-ar,[3] namely, ‘letter’; but every time that word type is written, a new word token has been created.

Some logicians consider a word type to be the class of its tokens. Other logicians counter that the word type has a permanence and constancy not found in the class of its tokens. The type remains the same while the class of its tokens is continually gaining new members and losing old members.



*Occurrences of Numerals*

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occurrences_of_numerals

Numerals—strings of characters called digits—are types not tokens, using Pierce's type-token distinction. Written tokens of numerals are visible and can be destroyed: erased, eradicated, incinerated, and so on.

In senses used in this article, there are exactly ten digits—0,1, …, 9—, each a one-digit numeral.  All longer numerals are concatenations of shorter numerals, where ‘concatenation’ is used in the sense of concatenation theory or string theory.

What is “an occurrence”? As detailed in various places including the Wikipedia article type-token distinction, some authors have accepted as answer The Prefix Proposal that a given occurrence of a numeral in a given numeral be identified with the initial sub-numeral ending with the given occurrence. This means that the first occurrence of 12 in 12312 is 12 itself and the second occurrence of 12 in 12312 is 12312 itself. It further means the first occurrence of 12 in 12312 occurs in the second occurrence of 12 in 12312. Finally, it means that the length of an occurrence of a numeral depends on the numeral it occurs in and its order of occurrence: the first occurrence of 12 in 12312 is a two-digit numeral whereas the second occurrence of 12 in 12312 is a five digit-numeral.



*More examples:*

You may show someone the bicycle in your garage, but you cannot show someone "The bicycle". Tokens always exist at a particular place and time and may be shown to exist as a concrete physical object.

If we say that two people "have the same car", we may mean that they have the same type of car (e.g. the same brand and model), or the same particular token of the car (e.g. they share a single vehicle).

### nominalization

an abstract query on a model which results in a database "view" or subset can be thought of as a "nominalization", caching the value of some query:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominalization

(they must be countable to use w/ a database)

e.g.
`the poor`
Person.find({ income: { '<=': threshold }})
