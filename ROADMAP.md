> Also take a second to check that your feature request is relevant to Sails core and not one of its dependencies (e.g. Waterline, one of its adapters, one of the core generators, etc.)  If you aren't sure, feel free to send the PR here and someone will make sure it finds its way to the right place.  Note that (for now) core hooks reside in Sails core and so relevant feature requests for a specific hook _do_ belong in this file.

## Roadmap

Our short-to-medium-term roadmap items, in order of descending priority:

_(feel free to suggest things)_


 Feature                                                  | Owner                                                                            | Details
 :------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------
 

#### Backlog

The backlog consists of features which are not currently in the immediate-term roadmap above, but are useful.  We would exuberantly accept a pull request implementing any of the items below, so long as it was accompanied with reasonable tests that prove it, and it doesn't break other core functionality.

 Feature                                         | Owner                                              | Details
